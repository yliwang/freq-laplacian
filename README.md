# In frequency, a Laplacian filter can be defined by H(u,v) = -(u**2 + v**2). In this project one is required to implement this filter in the Fourier frequency domain. 
A python proto-type code is provided, and one should implement the function called FreqLaplacian, which accepts an numpy array as input, and returns filtered result as another numpy array.
Note: The most difficult part of this project is how to represent the filtered result.
